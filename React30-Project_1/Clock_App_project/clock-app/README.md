This is **Project 3** of my **#React30 Challenge** â€“ a **Digital Clock** built using React.  
The clock updates every second using the `useEffect` and `useState` hooks.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Real-time clock that updates every second
- Clean, modern UI with CSS styling
- Functional React component structure
- Responsive design
- Glowing effect on the clock border

## ðŸ“š What I Learned

- React `useState` for managing dynamic values
- React `useEffect` for running side effects like intervals
- How to clean up side effects to avoid memory leaks
- Styling and layout improvements using CSS
- Real-time rendering using React

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- React.js (CRA setup)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS3


## ðŸŽ¥ Resources

This project was inspired by a **YouTube tutorial React js with Everyday Karma** where I followed the concepts and built my own version to strengthen my understanding of:
- `useEffect` & cleanup functions
- UI rendering in React
- Component state and re-rendering

## ðŸš§ Future Improvements

- Add date display
- Dark/Light theme toggle
- Add time zone selector
- Add animation or sound
