![Pasted image (6)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95066927-6361-4539-8e33-160be9ed057a)

This is **Project 5** from my #React30 Challenge — a simple yet visually pleasing **Image Gallery App** built with React.js and styled using Bootstrap and CSS Grid.

## 🚀 Features

- Fetches a list of images from a public API (`picsum.photos`)
- Displays the images in a scrollable, responsive grid layout
- Styled using Bootstrap and custom CSS
- Each image card shows the photographer’s name and a button to view the original photo

## 🔧 What I Used

- **React.js**
- **Axios** for API requests
- **useState** and **useEffect** hooks
- **Bootstrap** for layout and design
- **CSS Grid** for gallery structure



## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-gallery-app.git
cd image-gallery-app
npm install
npm start
