# 🚀 React30 Projects Challenge

Welcome to the **React30 Projects** series — a 30-project coding challenge where I build 30 hands-on frontend projects, starting with core JavaScript and moving into React.js and the MERN stack. This journey is designed to **solidify frontend skills** and **build a strong development portfolio**.

## 📌 About the Challenge

React30 is a curated set of **16–30 frontend projects** created using **JavaScript, React, and MERN stack** technologies. The goal is to help learners (like myself!) become confident in:

- React fundamentals & advanced hooks
- JavaScript ES6+ features
- DOM manipulation & UI logic
- Full-stack app architecture (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)
- Clean code and real-world project structure
